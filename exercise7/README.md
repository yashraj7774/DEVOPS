# Exercise 7 — Introduction to Continuous Integration (CI) and Jenkins Installation

## 1. Jenkins Docker Container Deployment

The Jenkins LTS image was downloaded, and the Jenkins container was started successfully. Since host port `8080` was unavailable, Jenkins was exposed on port `8081`, mapped to container port `8080`. The container was verified as running with Docker.
